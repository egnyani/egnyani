# Welcome to My Profile! üëî I'm Gnyani Enugandula
# Welcome to My Profile! I'm Gnyani Enugandula

As a passionate data analyst and second year grad at Syracuse University completing my Master's in Information Systems, I've had the chance to dive deep into data, uncovering insights that drive smarter decisions. I'm particularly passionate about using my analytical skills in areas like women's empowerment, utilizing data to advocate for and advance women's rights globally.

## What I'm working on üöÄ
- **Enhancing Women's Educational and Economic Opportunities in India**: This project aims to analyze data on women's access to education and economic participation in India. By collaborating with educational institutions and NGOs, the goal is to create data-driven strategies that increase enrollment rates, improve educational resources, and facilitate greater economic independence for women.

- **Tennis Performance Analysis: Rafael Nadal**: Focused on one of tennis's greatest players, this project utilizes match data to analyze Rafael Nadal's performance trends over the years. By studying his play patterns, injury history, and match outcomes, the analysis helps understand factors contributing to his success and longevity in the sport.

## My Toolkit üß∞
- **Languages**: Python, C, SQL, C#
- **Technologies**: Flask, React.js, Tableau, Pandas, NumPy
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **Cloud**: AWS, Azure
